                    DBGrow Inc. (henceforth "DBGrow"), located in Berkeley, CA 94707, United States and its subsidiaries
                    or affiliates involved in providing the Service (together, "DBGrow"). If you are an individual, you
                    represent and warrant that you have the legal right to enter into the Terms. If you are entering
                    into the Terms on behalf of a legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to
                    bind that entity and agree that the entity will bear full responsibility for the compliance of the

                    (ii) do not accept and agree to be bound by the Terms in their entirety, then you are not permitted
                    to access or use the Service. Your permission to access and use the Service is conditioned upon your
                    continued and uninterrupted compliance with the Terms. The "Service" means the services DBGrow makes
                    available through the DBGrow.com website or DBGrow API and any other software or services offered by
                    DBGrow in connection to any of those. You acknowledge and agree that your access to or use of the
                    Service will indicate your acceptance of the Terms.</p>

                <p>1.2. You may not use the Service if you are a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws
                    of the United States or any other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from
                    which you access and use the Service. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is

            <h3>8. Modification and Termination of the Service</h3>
            <article>
                <p>8.1. DBGrow is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users.
                    You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Service which DBGrow provides may change
                    from time to time at DBGrow's sole discretion and without prior notice to you. Examples of changes

                <p>8.2. You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time. DBGrow may, at any time, terminate your
                    use of the Service and/or these Terms if (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or DBGrow
                    reasonably believes that you do not intend to or are unable to comply with the provisions of the

                    the provision of the Service); (C) the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party
                    partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires
                    DBGrow to change the way DBGrow provides the data or services through the Service; (D) providing the
                    Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by DBGrow in its reasonable good
                    faith judgment; (E) providing the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden
                    as determined by DBGrow in its reasonable good faith judgment; (F) DBGrow ceases commercially
                    offering or provisioning all or a portion of the Service; or (G) you are in arrears with respect to
                    any payment due DBGrow under the Terms.</p>

                    reasonable effort to give you access to, and the ability to export, your Content and Application(s)
                    for a reasonable amount of time. If you voluntarily discontinue your use of the Service, you are

            <h3>15. General Legal Terms</h3>
            <article>
                <p>15.1. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors,
                    and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture. Neither party will have
                    the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other's behalf without such other party's
                    prior written consent.</p>

                <p>15.2. You may not assign or transfer the Terms, in whole or in part, without the DBGrow's prior
                    written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be null,
                    void, and without effect. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, the Terms shall inure to the
                    benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</p>

                <p>15.3. You agree that DBGrow may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the
                    Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service. If you have provided DBGrow with your
                    email address, you acknowledge and agree that DBGrow may send you any notices required by law by
                    email instead of by regular mail.</p>

                <p>15.4. You agree that if DBGrow does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
                    contained in the Terms (or which DBGrow has the benefit of under any applicable law), that such
                    inaction will not be considered or deemed a formal waiver of DBGrow's rights and that those rights
                    or remedies will still be available to DBGrow.</p>

                <p>15.5. DBGrow shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting
                    from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action,
                    acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures,
                    and Internet disturbances.</p>

                <p>15.6. The Terms, and your relationship with DBGrow under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of
                    the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and DBGrow agree to
                    submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Berkeley, California
                    to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that DBGrow
                    shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>15.7. If any provision of the Terms is found to be contrary to law or public policy by a court of
                    competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be of no force or effect; but the remainder of the
                    Terms shall continue in full force and effect. The parties shall meet and confer in good faith with
                    respect to any provision found to be in contravention of the law or public policy in order to agree
                    on a substitute provision.</p>

                <p>15.8. If DBGrow provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the
                    English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict between the English
                    and translated versions.</p>

                <p>15.9. The headings in the Terms are for the convenience of reference only and have no legal
                    effect.</p>
