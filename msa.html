            <h3>1. Your Agreement with DBGrow</h3>
            <article>
                <p>1.1. This Master Services Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into by and between DBGrow Inc.
                    (henceforth "DBGrow"), including its subsidiaries and affiliates involved in providing
                    the
                    Services (together, "DBGrow" or "we") and you, the individual or legal entity ("Customer" or "you")
                    that wishes to access and use DBGrow's no-cost services or to purchase DBGrow Subscription Services
                    (defined below) (together, the "Service"). Your use of and access to the Service is governed by this
                    Agreement, which includes the DBGrow Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, and, for purchasers of
                    select Standalone or Replica Set plans, the Service Level Agreement ("SLA").</p>
                <p>1.2. This Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between DBGrow and Customers. By clicking
                    the "I Accept" button (or comparable acknowledgment option), you are indicating that you have read,
                    understand, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Customer is an
                    individual, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to enter into this Agreement. If
                    Customer is a legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the
                    Customer. If you (i) do not have the authority to bind the Customer; or (ii) do not agree to be
                    bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then neither you nor the legal entity you
                    may represent are permitted to purchase, access, or use the Services and you should not click the "I
                    Accept" button (or comparable acknowledgment option). Your permission to access and use the Services
                    is conditioned on your continued and uninterrupted compliance with the terms and conditions of this
                    Agreement.</p>

                    Service. You agree to promptly update your registration information, if any such information becomes
                    inaccurate or obsolete.</p>
                <p>2.2. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and all other credentials used for

            <h3>3. Subscription Services, Fees, and Payment</h3>
            <article>
                <p>3.1. DBGrow makes certain features, services, and support available for purchase on a monthly basis
                    by
                    Account holders (certain "Subscription Services"). DBGrow calculates and bills fees and charges
                    monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is
                    fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. Fees for partial months of access to Subscription Services
                    will be pro-rated based on the number of days the Subscription Services were made available to you.
                    You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Subscription Services using one of
                    the payment methods we support. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be made without setoff
                    or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Subscription
                    Services or new feature of a Subscription Service will be effective when we post updated fees and
                    charges on <a href="/pricing">https://dbgrow.com/pricing</a> or any successor or related site
                    designated by
                    us (our "Site") unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and
                    charges for any existing Services by giving you at least thirty (30) days' advance notice. We may
                    charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on
                    all late payments.</p>
                <p>3.2. All fees and charges payable by you are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT
                    and applicable sales tax. You will provide us any information we reasonably request to determine
                    whether we are obligated to collect VAT from you, including your VAT identification number. If you
                    are legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, you are
                    responsible for providing us with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing
                    jurisdiction. We will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under your account occurring
                    after the date we receive the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is
                    required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that
                    the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have
                    received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide us with
                    documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing
                    authority.</p>

            <h3>5. Modification and Termination of the Agreement</h3>
            <article>
                <p>5.1. DBGrow may make changes to this Agreement from time to time at its sole discretion. When these
                    changes are made, DBGrow will make a new copy of the agreement available through your Account
                    accessible at the Site. The revised Agreement will identify the date the Agreement was last
                    revised.</p>
                <p>5.2. You acknowledge and agree that your continued access to or use of the Service after the date on
                    which the revised Agreement has been made available through your Account will indicate your
                    acceptance of the revised Agreement. If you do not accept the revised Agreement, your only recourse
                    is to stop using the Service and terminate this Agreement. If your acceptance of the Agreement by
                    continued access or use of the Service is found to be contrary to law or public policy or
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the most recent version of the Agreement
                    that is enforceable and not contrary to law or public policy will be deemed to have remained in
                    effect and to govern your use of the Services.</p>
                <p>5.3. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by deleting all Your Content, discontinuing your
                    use of the Service and closing your Account. DBGrow may, at any time and at its sole discretion,
                    terminate your use of the Service if (A) you have breached any provision of the Agreement (or DBGrow
                    reasonably believes that you do not intend to or are unable to comply with the provisions of the
                    Agreement); (B) DBGrow is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law
                    governing
                    the provision of the Service); (C) the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party
                    partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires
                    DBGrow to change the way DBGrow provides the data or services through the Service; (D) providing the
                    Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by DBGrow in its reasonable good
                    faith judgment; (E) providing the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden
                    as determined by DBGrow in its reasonable good faith judgment; (F) DBGrow ceases commercially
                    offering
                    or provisioning all or a portion of the Service; or (G) you are in arrears with respect to any
                    payment due to DBGrow under this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement shall also terminate the
                    Terms of Service.</p>
                <p>5.4. Sections 5.4, 6, and 7 of this Agreement and all Sections of the Terms of Service that are
                    identified therein as surviving termination shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

            <h3>6. General Legal Terms</h3>
            <article>
                <p>6.1. There are no third party beneficiaries to the Agreement. The parties are independent
                    contractors, and nothing in these Agreement creates an agency, partnership or joint venture. Neither
                    party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other's behalf without
                    such other party's prior written consent.</p>
                <p>6.2. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without DBGrow's prior
                    written
                    consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be null, void, and
                    without effect. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
                    the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</p>
                <p>6.3. You agree that DBGrow may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this
                    Agreement, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service. If you have provided DBGrow with your
                    email address, you acknowledge and agree that DBGrow may send you any notices required by law by
                    email
                    instead of by regular mail.</p>
                <p>6.4. You agree that if DBGrow does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
                    contained
                    in this Agreement (or which DBGrow has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be
                    taken to be a formal waiver of DBGrow's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
                    available to DBGrow.</p>
                <p>6.5. DBGrow shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from
                    any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts
                    of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and
                    Internet disturbances.</p>
                <p>6.6. This Agreement, and your relationship with DBGrow under this Agreement, shall be governed by the
                    laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and DBGrow
                    agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San
                    Francisco, California to resolve any legal matter arising from this Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                    you agree that DBGrow shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type
                    of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>6.7. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be contrary to law or public policy by a court of
                    competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be of no force or effect; but the remainder of this
                    Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The parties shall meet and confer in good faith
                    with respect to any provision found to be in contravention of the law or public policy in order to

            <h3>Attachment A: Service Level Agreement ("SLA")</h3>
            <article>
                <p>This SLA applies only to those portions of the service provided under DBGrow Production Plans that
                    are
                    directly billed by DBGrow and have been defined by DBGrow a Standalone or Replica Set plan, where
                    each
                    node is
                    on a Dedicated Virtual Machine with greater than or equal to 0.5GB of RAM. "Standalone" and "Replica
                    Set" plans include only
                    Replica Set Clusters and Sharded Clusters where each shard is a Replica Set with the requisite
                    number of data-bearing nodes. The requisite number of data-bearing nodes is two unless the storage
                    used for each node is considered ephemeral, in which case the number of requisite nodes is three. We
                    reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

                <h4>Service Commitment</h4>
                <p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make your MongoDB Deployments (defined below) High
                    Availability Plan available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.95%, in each case during
                    any monthly billing cycle (the "Service Commitment"). In the event that we do not meet the Service
                    Commitment, you may be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.</p>

                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <p>"MongoDB Deployment" means the MongoDB Replica Set Cluster or Sharded Cluster that we provide to you
                    under a High Availability Plan.</p>
                <p>"Monthly Uptime Percentage" for a monthly billing cycle is calculated by subtracting from 100% the
                    percentage of minutes during the month in which your MongoDB Deployment was in a state of
                    "Unavailability", excluding any period of "Excused Unavailability".</p>
                <ul>
                    <h5>Example</h5>
                    <li class="white">For a 31-day month in which there is 150 minutes of Unavailability of which 50
                        minutes are Excused Unavailability:<br>
                        Monthly Uptime Percentage = 100% - 100min / (31 days*24 hours/day *60 min/hour) = 99.776%
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>"Unavailable" and "Unavailability" means that at least one Replica Set Cluster of a MongoDB
                    Deployment has no reachable member that is in the state PRIMARY for a period of 5 minutes.</p>
                <p>"Excused Unavailability" means any Unavailability that (i) occurs during an Excused Maintenance
                    Period or (ii) is caused by or results from: (a) our suspension or termination of your right to use
                    the Service in accordance with this Agreement; (b) factors outside of our reasonable control,
                    including, without limitation, force majeure events and network, Internet, or other access or
                    availability problems beyond the demarcation point of DBGrow; (c) your or any third party's action
                    or
                    inaction, including without limitation failure to properly configure system components; (d)
                    third-party equipment, software, hardware, or technology that is not in our direct control.</p>
                <p>"Excused Maintenance Period" means any Unavailability period during which we are performing (i)
                    scheduled maintenance of your MongoDB Deployment; or (ii) unscheduled maintenance of your MongoDB
                    Deployment of which you have been furnished at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice.</p>
                <p>"Service Credit" is a dollar credit, calculated as a percentage of the fees paid during the
                    applicable monthly billing cycle for the affected MongoDB Replica Set Cluster or Sharded Cluster for
                    which the Unavailability is experienced.</p>

                </table>

                <h4>Service Credit</h4>
                <p>If: (i) the Monthly Uptime Percentage for a monthly billing cycle for which you have purchased and
                    fully paid for Services is less than the Service Commitment (99.95%); (ii) you are current on all
                    payments at the time the reported Unavailability occurred; and (iii) you have not been late on
                    payments more than two (2) times in the last twelve (12) months, we will apply a Service Credit
                    against future payments otherwise due from you to DBGrow. At our discretion, we may alternatively
                    issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the monthly billing cycle in which
                    the Unavailability occurred. Service Credits issued to you may not be transferred or applied to any
                    other account. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any
                    Unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide the Service is the receipt of a
                    Service Credit (if you are eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.</p>
                <p>To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by emailing us at <a
                        href="mailto:support@dbgrow.com">support@dbgrow.com</a>. To be eligible, the credit request must
                    be
                    received by us within thirty (30) days of the Unavailability and must include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line;</li>
                    <li>the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;</li>
                    <li>the name of the applicable High Availability plan and affected cluster id(s); and</li>
                    <li>sufficient evidence and detailed information outlining the impact, including but not limited to
                        duration of the event, log files, ping metrics, and other availability metrics from third
                        parties.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service
                    Commitment and you are eligible to receive a Service Credit (as described above), then we will issue
                    the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is
                    approved by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information within thirty (30) days of
                    the Unavailability as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.</p>
