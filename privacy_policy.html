            <p>DBGrow Inc. (henceforward <strong>"DBGrow"</strong>, <strong>"we"</strong> or <strong>"us"</strong>)
                understands that Users care about their privacy and how their personally identifiable information is
                used and shared. As such, we at DBGrow have a firm commitment to the privacy and protection of our
                Users.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect via our Service and our Site and describes how
                we collect and use such information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of
                your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information. By visiting
                our Site or using our Service, you are consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they
                are accessible through our Service or our Site. </p>

            <p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have been defined in our Terms of Service
                (available at <a href="/tos" target="_self">https://dbgrow.com/tos</a>). Therefore,

            <p> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred to, and maintained on computers or servers,
                that are located outside of your state, province or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy
                laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the US and
                choose to provide your personally identifiable information to us, we may transfer your personally
                identifiable information to the United States and process it there. We work with our customers and

        <h3>What information do we collect about you?</h3>
        <article>
            <p><strong>User-provided information</strong> - DBGrow only collects personally identifiable information
                that you have voluntarily provided to us. We only ask for information that's necessary for you (and your
                Authorized Users) to access, use and pay for our Service, including, but not limited to, the creation of
                your Account. This information may include, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, mailing
                addresses and credit card numbers. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your
                email messages and our responses so that we can provide you with better customer service. We also store
                information that you have indirectly provided to us via Your Content and Application(s), which may
                include, without limitation, your Users' personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p><strong>Log file information</strong> - Information is automatically reported by your browser each time
                you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information
                that your web browser sends. These server logs may include information such as your web request,
                Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain
                names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We use this information to identify
                potential security issues, to analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) trends, to administer
                the Site, to track averaged User movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about
                our User base as a whole. We may also use this information to improve, customize and enhance our Service
                by expanding the Service's features and functionality and tailoring the Service to our Users'
                preferences. We do not use this information to identify individual Users.</p>

        <article>
            <p>We use cookies on our Site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for
                record-keeping purposes.</p>

            <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are required for most of the
                functionality of our Site and for web tools such as our administrative application. These cookies are
                used to implement application authentication, allowing us to implement secure access to your data. A
                session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.</p>

            <p>A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent
                cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies
                enable us to track and target your interests and to improve our Site.</p>

            <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some key areas of our Site,
                such as our administrative application tools, will be disabled.</p>

            <p>Our Site does not have the capability to respond to "Do Not Track" signals received from various web
                browsers.</p>

        <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>
        <article>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. On those pages where our users can register
                for our service and/or log-in, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer

            <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to
                us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
                method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can email us at <a

            <p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Site in addition to other endorsements. We
                may repost testimonials that are publicly available on social media networks (like Twitter) without your

            <p>In the customer support area of our Site, you can log in using sign-in services such as "Sign in Using
                Google". These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain
                personally identifiable information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign
                up form. Services of this nature give you the option to sync and share information with others within
                your network.</p>

            <p>Certain portions of our Site, such as the blog, include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like
                button or Twitter button. These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, which page you are
                visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Social Media Feature to function properly.
                Social Media Features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
                Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company
